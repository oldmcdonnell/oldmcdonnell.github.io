<h1>Week 2 Blog</h1>

<h3>What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</h3>

<p class="p1">I already used things like dreamweaver and photoshop to create websites. I'm having to start all over and it's infuriating because I know there are applications that can do 10^10 what I can in code</p>

<h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>

<p class="p1">Things are out of order for no reason... I have no idea what is going on here... <p>

<h3>How do you solve a problem? </h3>

<p class*"p1">Usually i search for solutions or look for other code. Sometimes I will ask for help.</p>

<h3>What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck? </h3>
<p class="p1">I will work on something else or relax and change focus. Sometimes watching a dumb show for a couple minutes can help me relax and then I sometimes come up with a better solution</p>
